## Overview

Arqiver (by Pedram Pourang, a.k.a. Tsu Jan <tsujan2000@gmail.com>) is a simple Qt5 archive manager as a front-end for libarchive (bsdtar), gzip and 7z.

Arqiver can extract, create and edit archives that are supported by its back-ends. It can open archives by drag-and-drop. Its listed items can be viewed separately or dragged and dropped into appropriate applications. With 7z, it also supports password protection.

Please see INSTALL for instructions on compilation, installation and translation!
